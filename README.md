# Exploring_climate_change_with_global_temperature

Problem Description
The objective of this project is to explore climate change by analyzing global temperature data. The dataset used in this project is obtained from Kaggle, which contains earth surface temperature data from various sources such as weather stations, ships, and satellites from 1750 to 2015. The dataset has a total of 8 columns, which includes information such as date, average temperature, average temperature uncertainty, city, country, and latitude/longitude.
The main aim of this project Is to analyze the changes in global temperatures over the years and identify any trends or patterns in the data. The project will involve preprocessing the data to ensure that it is clean and ready for analysis. The dataset will be explored using various data visualization techniques to gain insights and identify any patterns. The project will also involve the use of statistical analysis methods to validate any findings.
